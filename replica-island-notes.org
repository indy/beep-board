(invoked by GameThread:)

    GLSurfaceView
      GameRenderer



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Game

mGame .setSurfaceView mGLSurfaceView
mGame .bootstrap <<- creates a GameRenderer
mGLSurfaceView.setRenderer(mGame.getRenderer());

all gamestate changes, pauses etc go through mGame


* GameThread
  manages synchronization of input events, and handles the draw queue
  swap with the rendering thread.

  implements Runnable

  mGameThread = new GameThread(mRenderer);
  setGameRoot sets the MainLoop


  has a looping run method that communicates with the renderer thread
  and a bunch of methods for handling pauses

* MainLoop
  extends ObjectManager
  had one method called update that takes timeDelta and a baseObject

* GameRenderer

  who calls the GameRenderer?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

so there's the game loop thread, the rendering loop thread and the
pseudo-singleton pattern of the BaseObject.sSystemRegistry to pass
messages
